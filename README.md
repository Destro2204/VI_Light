# Smart Lighting Control System

This repository contains the **Smart Lighting Control System**, a project aimed at enhancing energy efficiency and simplifying the management of outdoor lighting for a corporate building. The system combines modern technologies such as Flutter for mobile applications, ESP8266 microcontrollers for hardware control, and WebSocket protocol for seamless communication.

## 🚀 Features

- **Manual and Automatic Modes**: 
  - Manually control lights via the app.
  - Automatic lighting adjustment based on calculated sunrise and sunset times.
- **Wireless Communication**: Real-time communication between the app and the ESP8266 using WebSocket over a local network.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: An intuitive Flutter-based application designed for simplicity and ease of use.
- **Standalone Solution**: Operates without requiring an internet connection, using an RTC module for timekeeping.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Flutter**: Cross-platform mobile development framework for the application.
- **ESP8266**: Microcontroller for hardware control of relays connected to the lights.
- **WebSocket**: Protocol for efficient two-way communication.
- **RTC Module**: Maintains accurate time for automatic mode functionality.
